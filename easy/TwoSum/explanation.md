To explain the `time` and `space` complexity of the code:

- `Time Complexity`:

  The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array. Here's why:

  The for loop iterates through the nums array once. This loop runs exactly n times, where n is the length of the input array.

  Inside the loop, we perform the following operations:

  Calculating the complement (`complement = target - nums[i]`) takes constant time, O(1).
  Checking if the complement exists in the numIndices Map (`numIndices.has(complement)`) also takes constant time, O(1).
  Adding an entry to the numIndices Map (`numIndices.set(nums[i], i)`) takes constant time, O(1).
  Since all these operations are performed sequentially within the loop, and they all take constant time, the overall time complexity remains O(n) because the loop's time complexity dominates the operations inside it.

- `Space Complexity:`

  The space complexity of this solution is `O(n)` as well. Here's why:

  We use a Map called `numIndices` to store numbers and their indices. In the worst case, when there are no duplicate numbers in the `nums` array, the map can store all `n` numbers, resulting in `O(n)` space usage.

  Other variables used in the function, such as `i`, `complement`, and the return array, consume only a constant amount of space and do not depend on the input size.
