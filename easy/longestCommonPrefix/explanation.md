To explain the `time` and `space` complexity of the code:

- `Time Complexity`:

The time complexity of this function is O(n * m), where:

n is the number of strings in the input array strs.
m is the length of the longest common prefix.
Here's why:
  
The outer loop iterates through the characters of the first string, which has a length of m.

The inner loop compares characters in all other strings. In the worst case, it has to compare all characters in all strings (O(n * m) comparisons).

The code returns the common prefix found so far when a mismatch is encountered, which happens after at most m comparisons in the inner loop.

In the worst case, where the common prefix spans the entire length of all strings, the time complexity is O(n * m).

Space Complexity:

The space complexity of this function is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of extra space. The space usage does not depend on the input size but remains constant throughout the execution. The variables i, char, and j are used for iteration and do not consume additional space relative to the input. The slice operation creates a new string with a length of at most m, which is also constant relative to the input size.
