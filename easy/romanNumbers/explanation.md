To explain the `time` and `space` complexity of the code:

- `Time Complexity`:

  Creating a Set (numsSet) and initializing a variable (currentIndex) both take constant time, O(1).

  The while loop iterates through the nums array once. In the worst case, it will iterate through the entire array once, making it O(n), where n is the length of the nums array.

  Inside the loop, we perform constant-time operations:

  Checking if an element is in the set (numsSet.has(currentNum)) takes O(1) on average.
  Adding an element to the set (numsSet.add(currentNum)) takes O(1) on average.
  Removing an element from the array (nums.splice(currentIndex, 1)) takes O(n) in the worst case, but on average, it's more like O(1) because the array shifting is done efficiently.
  Overall, the time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array, because the while loop iterates through each element in the array once.

- `Space Complexity`:

  The numsSet Set is used to store unique elements from the nums array. In the worst case, if all elements are unique, the Set could store up to n elements, where n is the length of the nums array. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

  Other variables (currentIndex, currentNum) used in the code take constant space, O(1).

Overall, the space complexity of this code is O(n) due to the space used by the numsSet, where n is the length of the nums array.
