To explain the `time` and `space` complexity of the code:

- `Time Complexity`:

  The for loop iterates through the nums array once, starting from the third element (currentIndex is initialized to 2). It iterates exactly once for each element in the array, making it a linear time complexity, O(n), where n is the length of the nums array.

  The while loop at the end of the code is used to remove any extra elements from the nums array. In the worst case, it removes n - currentIndex elements, where n is the length of the nums array. However, the pop operation generally takes constant time on average, so it can be considered O(1) for practical purposes.

  Overall, the time complexity of the code is dominated by the for loop, making it O(n).

- `Space Complexity:`

  The code modifies the nums array in-place, without using any additional data structures other than a few variables (currentIndex, i, etc.). Therefore, the space complexity of the code is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
  In summary, the code has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for removing duplicates from the nums array while keeping at most two occurrences of each unique element.
