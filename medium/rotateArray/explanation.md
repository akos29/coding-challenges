To explain the `time` and `space` complexity of the code:

- `Time Complexity`:

  Calculating k % n takes constant time, O(1), because it's a simple arithmetic operation.

  Reversing the entire array using the reverse function takes O(n/2) time, which is effectively O(n).

  Reversing the first k elements also takes O(k/2) time, which is effectively O(k).

  Reversing the remaining elements takes O((n - k)/2) time, which is effectively O(n - k).

  Since all these operations are performed sequentially and don't involve nested loops, the overall time complexity of the rotate function is O(n).

- `Space Complexity:`

  The space complexity of the code is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. It doesn't create any new data structures or allocate additional memory based on the size of the input array. The rotations are performed in-place, and the reverse function uses only a few temporary variables, so the space complexity remains constant.

  In summary, the code is both time and space-efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it a good solution for rotating an array in-place by k positions.
